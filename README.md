573 Final Project
Uses JRA-55 data, climatology, and RMM indices to analyze column integrated heating anomalies over the course of many years.
JRA-55_tropical is the daily JRA-55 data truncated to tropical latitudes only. RMM has the RMM indices which indicate phase and amplitude as well as the corresponding phase the MJO is in for given date. Climatology2 has daily climatology values for one year which will eventually be subtracted to get anomalies.
573.yml file is environment that was used to work on this project.
573 Jupyter Notebook has python code used for the analysis.
